# Aghs.js

## About

Aghs.js is my personal game engine that I'm developing. Having meddled with others, I was curious of the internal workings.
It touts a few things, that I personally enjoy:

- Written in coffeescript
- simple plugins
- Extended canvasRenderingContext API, with a chainable syntax

Also, I plan to add the following

- Tests
- Hand-written documentation
