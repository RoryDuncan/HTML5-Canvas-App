<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>Aghs.js is my personal game engine that Iâ€™m developing. Having meddled with others, I was curious of the internal workings.<br>It touts a few things, that I personally enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Written in coffeescript</li>
<li>simple plugins</li>
<li>Extended canvasRenderingContext API, with a chainable syntax</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I plan to add the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Tests</li>
<li>Hand-written documentation</li>
</ul>

To be added:

## Example Usage
## Getting Started
## Next Steps
## Documentation
